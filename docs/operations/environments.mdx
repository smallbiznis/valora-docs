title: Environments
description: Separate dev, staging, and production safely.
---

Use workspaces to separate environments and avoid cross-contamination of billing data.

## Recommended setup
- `dev`: experimentation and schema evolution
- `staging`: validation against production-like traffic
- `prod`: authoritative billing data

## Key practices
- Separate API keys per workspace.
- Never share customers across environments.
- Keep pricing changes versioned and reviewed.
