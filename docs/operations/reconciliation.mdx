description: Validate billed usage against source systems.

Reconciliation ensures your billing output matches internal source-of-truth data.

## Workflow
1. Export usage events from your source system.
2. Compare totals to ledger entries for the same window.
3. Resolve differences and run targeted backfills if needed.
