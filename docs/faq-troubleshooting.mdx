## Why is an event missing from the ledger?
Ensure the event passed schema validation and that the meter matched the event. Check event status via `GET /v1/usage/events/{event_id}`.

## Why did I receive a 409 error?
A `409` indicates a duplicate `event_id`. Generate a new unique ID and retry.

## How do I validate invoices before sending them?
Use the draft invoice endpoint and compare line items against your internal usage reports.
