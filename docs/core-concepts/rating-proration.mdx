Rating converts usage into billable amounts based on pricing rules.

## Rating flow
- Validate the event against a meter.
- Apply pricing rules and tiers.
- Emit ledger entries with monetary amounts.

## Proration
Valora supports proration when subscriptions or pricing change mid-cycle. Rating records the delta as separate ledger entries for clear audit trails.
