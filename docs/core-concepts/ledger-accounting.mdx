The ledger is the source of truth for all billable activity.

## Ledger entries
- Immutable, append-only records.
- Reference the source usage event or subscription charge.
- Provide the basis for invoice line items.

## Accounting workflows
Ledger entries can be exported to downstream systems for revenue recognition, reconciliation, and audit.
