description: Isolation boundaries for teams, environments, and billing.

Organizations are the top-level tenancy boundary in Valora. Workspaces let you separate environments under a single organization.

## Organizations
- Own customers, products, and billing configuration.
- Provide isolation for data, access, and billing rules.

## Workspaces
- Commonly mapped to `dev`, `staging`, and `prod`.
- Use separate API keys and ingestion endpoints.
- Safe place to test new pricing and meters before production.
