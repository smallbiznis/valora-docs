The Billing API provides read-only access to billing artifacts.

## Endpoints
- `GET /v1/billing/customers/{customer_id}`
- `GET /v1/billing/invoices?customer_id=...`
- `GET /v1/billing/ledger/entries?customer_id=...`

## Notes
Billing endpoints are eventually consistent with usage ingestion and rating.
