title: Authentication (API keys)
description: Secure usage ingestion with scoped keys.
---

Usage ingestion uses API keys scoped to a workspace.

## Header format
Send the key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
-H "Authorization: Bearer $VALORA_API_KEY"
```

## Scope
Keys can be scoped to specific meters or customer segments. Use least-privilege keys for ingestion from edge systems.
