title: Batching & idempotency
description: Deliver events efficiently and safely.

Batching reduces request overhead and idempotency prevents double billing.

## Batching
Use the batch endpoint to submit many events in one request. Each event is processed independently so partial failures return per-event status.

## Idempotency
`event_id` is the idempotency key. Reusing an `event_id` results in a `409 Conflict` without creating additional ledger entries.
