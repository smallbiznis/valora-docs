The Usage API ingests events and turns them into rated usage.

## Base URLs

- OSS: your runtime endpoint (for example `https://billing.internal`)

## Typical flow
1. Authenticate with an API key.
2. Post usage events (single or batch).
3. Query event status or ledger entries.
4. Review invoice previews.
