title: Org isolation
description: Data boundaries across organizations and workspaces.
---

Valora enforces strict separation between organizations and their workspaces.

## Isolation guarantees
- Data is partitioned by organization and workspace.
- API keys are scoped to a single workspace.
- Ledger queries cannot cross org boundaries.
