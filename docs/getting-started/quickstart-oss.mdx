description: Deploy the runtime, ingest usage, and verify the ledger.
---

This walkthrough targets a minimal self-hosted setup for Valora OSS.

## Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Object storage for invoice artifacts (S3-compatible)
- Docker or a container runtime

## 1. Configure the runtime
Set the required environment variables for database, storage, and API keys.

```bash
export VALORA_DATABASE_URL="postgres://valora:valora@localhost:5432/valora"
export VALORA_STORAGE_BUCKET="valora-invoices"
export VALORA_API_KEY_SEED="change-me"
```

## 2. Start the services
Run the Valora runtime services and confirm health checks pass.

## 3. Bootstrap your org and admin
Use the bootstrap command or API to create the first organization, workspace, and admin user.

## 4. Send a usage event
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/usage/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VALORA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event_id": "evt_01HZZJNNM2TT2",
    "customer_id": "cus_oss_001",
    "meter_id": "meter_api_requests",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-12T15:04:05Z",
    "quantity": 42
  }'
```

## 5. Verify the ledger
Query the ledger endpoint for the customer and ensure a matching entry was recorded for the usage event.
