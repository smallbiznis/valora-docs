description: Send your first usage event and generate a draft invoice.

This walkthrough gets you from zero to a rated usage event in Valora Cloud.

## Prerequisites
- A Valora Cloud organization and workspace
- An API key with usage ingestion permissions

## 1. Create a product and pricing
Create a product with a usage-based component (for example, API calls). Configure pricing with a per-unit rate and billing cadence.

## 2. Create a meter
Meters define how incoming events map to billable usage. Example meter fields:
- `event_name`: `api.request`
- `value_path`: `$.quantity`
- `unit`: `request`

## 3. Send a usage event
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.valora.cloud/v1/usage/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VALORA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event_id": "evt_01HZZJH9M1TT1",
    "customer_id": "cus_123",
    "meter_id": "meter_api_requests",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-12T15:04:05Z",
    "quantity": 128,
    "properties": {
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "route": "/v1/usage/events"
    }
  }'
```

## 4. Preview the invoice
Use the Billing API to fetch the draft invoice or current period summary for the customer. Verify that the event appears as a rated line item.

## 5. Go live
Once you are confident in metering and pricing, enable the production workspace and rotate keys for your production workloads.
