description: Key entities and how they connect.

Valora is built around a few core entities that map directly to how SaaS businesses charge for usage.

## Key entities
- Organization: the top-level account boundary.
- Workspace: an environment within an organization (dev, staging, prod).
- Product: what you sell to customers.
- Price: how you charge (recurring, usage, tiered).
- Meter: how usage is measured.
- Rating: how usage becomes billable amounts.
- Ledger entry: the immutable financial record.
- Invoice: the customer-facing rollup of ledger entries.

## Typical lifecycle
Define products and meters, ingest usage, rate events, review ledger entries, and generate invoices.
