Valora is an open-core billing and usage engine for modern SaaS. It unifies subscriptions, usage-based pricing, metering, rating, ledger-based accounting, and invoices in a single system.

## What Valora does
- Models products, plans, and usage-based components.
- Ingests usage events and turns them into billable line items.
- Records all financial activity in a ledger for auditability.
- Generates invoices for downstream payment and ERP workflows.

## Cloud and OSS in one model
Valora Cloud provides a hosted control plane for configuration and management. Valora OSS provides the runtime you deploy in your environment. Both use the same data model and APIs, so concepts transfer directly.

## Who the docs are for
These docs are written for engineers integrating usage billing into production systems, whether you are using Valora Cloud, Valora OSS, or both.
