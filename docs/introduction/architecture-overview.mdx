description: How Valora is structured across control plane and runtime.
---

Valora separates configuration from execution so you can manage pricing and billing policies centrally while keeping usage processing close to your data.

## Control plane and runtime
- Control plane (Cloud): manages orgs, workspaces, pricing, and configuration.
- Runtime (OSS): ingests usage, rates events, and writes ledger entries.

## Data flow
1. Usage events are posted to the Usage API.
2. Metering validates and normalizes events.
3. Rating computes billable quantities and prices.
4. Ledger writes immutable entries.
5. Invoicing aggregates ledger entries into invoices.

## Storage and audit
Ledger entries are the source of truth. Every invoice line item references the underlying ledger entries for traceability and reconciliation.
