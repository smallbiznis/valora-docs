title: Cloud vs OSS
description: When to use Valora Cloud, Valora OSS, or both.
---

Valora Cloud and Valora OSS are designed to work together, but you can choose the model that fits your compliance, latency, and operational needs.

## Comparison

| Dimension | Valora Cloud | Valora OSS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hosting | Managed control plane | Self-hosted runtime |
| Usage ingestion | Optional (hosted) | Required (your infra) |
| Configuration | UI + API | API or config-first |
| Compliance | Cloud managed | You control data locality |
| Upgrades | Automatic | You schedule and run |

## Common patterns
- Cloud-only for fast teams that want managed control and ingestion.
- Hybrid: Cloud for control plane, OSS runtime for data locality.
- OSS-only for strict compliance or air-gapped environments.
